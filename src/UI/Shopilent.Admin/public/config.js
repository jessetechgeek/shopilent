// Development stub for runtime configuration
// This file prevents 404 errors during local development
// In production (Docker), this file is replaced by docker-entrypoint.sh with actual runtime values

// Leave window.ENV undefined - env.ts will fall back to import.meta.env
// window.ENV is only populated in production by the Docker entrypoint script
